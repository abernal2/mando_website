    Hiring Data Scientist/Optimization Engineers staff can be expensive for 
    small and medium sized companies. On top of that, powerful commercial 
    software to build and deploy said ML/optimization models adds to these costs. If you 
    want to leverage data science and optimization models but the costs are 
    prohibitive, then reach out to me to discuss how I can bring these models 
    into your business-decision arsenal at about one-third the annual costs.

    My name is Armando Bernal and I have worked for various companies, big and 
    small, startups and fortune 500 companies in the analytical division 
    informing their business-decision making process.

    ### Want to learn more?
    Please reach out to me to discuss your business analytical needs and costs
    to bring these models to production.
