    # Strategic Financial
    I developed their debt settlement optimization engine which optimizes
    an individuals' settlement program journey. Their previous application was implemented
    using commercial software. My implementation used all open-source software:

    - Coin-OR Branch & Cut (CBC) Optimization Solver
    - PuLP Optimization Modeling Python Package

    My implementation saved the company approximately $900K annually.

    # PepsiCo
    I developed PepsiCo's product promotion optimization model for Albertson's
    and Kroger grocery chains which determines the optimal selling price points.
    Ultimately, the optimization model determines the promotions for all of PepsiCo's
    potato chip brands at the National level. The revenue estimated from the model is
    in the range of \$50M - \$60M.
