    I grew up in the Northside of Chicago in the Albany Park neighborhood. Albany Park
    was and still is a rough neighborhood but it truly made me who I am. I went 
    to Roosevelt High School where I met my wife and have a wonderful baby daughter with.
    I strongly believe the AP Calculus course I took really sparked an interest in
    mathematics. Mathematics, oddly enough, did not start clicking until mid-Masters program at
    Stanford University, where I fell in love with mathematical optimization. 
    After having difficulty in acquiring a full-time job after Stanford, I enrolled in the 
    PhD Industrial Engineering program at the University of Michigan Ann-Arbor (thesis can de 
    downloaded from the Education section).
